# 🧠 DSA Diary: My Problem-Solving Journey

Welcome! This repo is my personal documentation of solving Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA) problems — from clueless to confident 😤  
Built with Python. Fueled by coffee and chaos.

---

## 🧩 Structure

- Organized by topic (`arrays`, `strings`, `linked_lists`, etc.)
- Each folder contains:
  - `.py` files for problems
  - A `readme.md` explaining approaches, learnings, and edge cases

---

## 📌 Why this repo?

- To understand **DSA deeply**, not just solve for the green tick
- To learn by doing, breaking, and fixing

## 🛠 How I Solve

1. **Watch + Read** theory like I’m 10 years old
2. **Solve easy toy problems**
3. **Move to real LeetCode problems**
4. If stuck, **debug deeply, write what I learned**
5. Push only clean, working, explained solutions

---

## 🧘 Goals

- Hit consistent daily practice
- Understand patterns, not memorize syntax
- Document what I *learn*, not just what I *solve*

Let’s grind. Let’s grow.
