# 🏃‍♀️🏃 Two Pointers Problems

This folder contains problems tagged as **Two Pointers** on LeetCode.

> The **two pointers** technique involves using two indices (or pointers) to iterate through a data structure, usually a list or string. This method is often used when you need to compare or combine values from both ends, track a window, or search for pairs.

It's especially powerful for:
- Solving problems in **O(n)** time where brute-force would be **O(n²)**
- Working on **sorted arrays**
- Problems involving **reversals**, **subarrays**, or **window-based processing**
