# ðŸ§  Hash Table Problems

This folder contains problems tagged as **Hash Table** on LeetCode.

> In Python, hash table problems are typically solved using `dict` or `set`. These built-in data structures provide constant-time average lookups, making them incredibly useful for efficient solutions.

Even if you're not explicitly using a `dict`, functions like `set()` and operations like set intersection rely on **hashing** under the hood â€” so they're fair game for this category.
